## TWEETING DISCONTINUED, SWITCH TO MASTODON OR DISCORD

NOTE -- WE HAVE DISCONTINUED SUPPORT FOR SENDING TWITTER NOTIFICATIONS
In short, the latest changes and uncertainties to the "X" platform have made it impossible to reliably send out Tweets. Many of us have gotten suspended from the platform because of notifications related to aircraft owned by Elon Musk. Also, the API that we are using will soon be discontinued, and the alternative (paid) options are expensive and not economically viable for the average hobbyist user.

Instead, consider notifications to Mastodon, BlueSky, or Discord. MQTT notifications are also supported. Instructions to set these up can be found:

- for Mastodon, [here](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/blob/main/README-Mastodon.md)
- for Discord, [here](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/blob/main/README-discord-alerts.md)
- for BlueSky and MQTT notifications, see the planefence.config file.
