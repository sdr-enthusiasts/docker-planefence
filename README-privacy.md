# Privacy Statement

Last updated: 24-Jan-2026

Planefence ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement explains how we handle information when you use our website.

Planefence is distributed as a software package (Docker container) and is installed, deployed, and/or operated by individuals ("Operators") unrelated to the author(s) or the SDR-Enthusiasts organization. These Operators run Planefence under the terms of the GNU Public License, version 3, and they have the sole and exclusive responsibility for the behavior of the software and for compliance with any applicable laws and regulations.

## 1. No Personal Information Collected

We designed this website so that we do not collect, store, or process personal information within the meaning of the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act ("CCPA/CPRA"), and Brazil's Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados Pessoais ("LGPD"). Note that your access request may pass through other web servers before it reaches us, and that these servers may handle your data differently. We have no knowledge of these, and they are outside of our span of control; you should manage your privacy requirements directly with these services if needed.

We do not collect, store, or process any information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to an individual ("personal information" or "personal data"), such as:

- Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or postal addresses
- User accounts or login details
- IP addresses linked to individuals
- Online identifiers or profiling data
- Location data
- Payment or transaction information

We also do not use analytics, advertising cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies that would allow us or third parties to identify or track individual users over time.

Because we do not collect personal information, we:

- Do not sell, share, or disclose personal information to third parties
- Do not use personal information for advertising, profiling, or marketing
- Do not conduct automated decision-making or profiling based on personal data

## 2. Information Stored in Your Browser (Local Storage / Cookies)

The website stores a very small amount of information only in your browser, solely to remember your preferences. This information is not sent to our servers and is not accessible to us in a form that identifies you.

We may store preference data in your browser (via local storage, cookies, or similar technologies), included but not limited to:

- Theme preference: whether you prefer dark mode or light mode
- Last viewed page: whether you last visited the "planefence" or "plane-alert" page
- Language preference: your selected language for the website
- Consent record (if opted in): whether you consented to us storing these preferences in your browser

These preference values:

- Are used only to improve your experience (e.g., remembering your chosen theme, language, and last page)
- Are stored locally in your browser and are not transmitted to us as personal data
- Do not contain your name, email, IP address, or any other personal identifier

If you choose not to allow this preference storage, you can still use the website, but you may have to re-select your preferences each time you visit.

## 3. Legal Basis and Compliance (GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, LGPD)

Under the GDPR and LGPD, we do not process personal data. The limited preference information stored in your browser is either necessary for providing the website's basic functionality and user experience (e.g., keeping your language selection), or stored with your consent where applicable. You may disable this storage at any time through your browser settings or by adjusting the preferences available on our website (if provided).

For California residents: We do not collect, sell, or share "personal information" as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. We do not disclose personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. We do not use or disclose "sensitive personal information." Because we do not collect personal information, the typical CCPA/CPRA rights (such as the right to access, delete, or correct personal information, and the right to opt out of sale or sharing) are generally not applicable to our website. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected personal information, please contact us using the details below, and we will address your request in accordance with applicable law.

## 4. Your Choices and Control

You can control how preference information is stored in your browser in the following ways:

- **Browser settings:** You can block or delete cookies and local storage data through your browser's privacy or security settings. If you do so, the website may no longer remember your dark/light mode, last visited page, language, or consent status.
- **On-site settings (if provided):** We may offer an in-page control (e.g., a toggle or banner) allowing you to opt in or out of storing preferences. If you opt out, we will attempt to stop storing new preference data in your browser, but your browser may still retain existing data until you clear it.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Our website is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or a higher age as defined by local law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since we do not collect personal information at all, we do not create profiles of children or target them for any purposes.

## 6. Third-Party Services

We design our website not to incorporate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services that collect personal information. If in the future we integrate any third-party content or tools that could process personal information, we will update this Privacy Statement, and provide clear information and controls consistent with applicable privacy laws.

## 7. International Users

Our website may be accessed from different countries, but our practices are designed so that we do not collect personal information from any user, regardless of location. To the extent any privacy law (such as the GDPR or LGPD) applies, our approach is to minimize data collection to non-personal preference data stored locally in your browser only.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Statement

We may update this Privacy Statement from time to time, for example, if we change how we store preferences or if we begin processing personal information in the future. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page, and post the revised Privacy Statement on this page. If we ever begin collecting personal information, we will update this Privacy Statement before such collection begins and, where required, obtain your consent.
