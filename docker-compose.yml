  # The following container enables adding screenshots to the Planefence Notifications.
  # The environment variable BASE_URL should be changed to point at YOUR OWN tar1090 or skyaware instance.
  # This should be the "hostname" (or "container_name" if hostname is not defined) of your tar1090 container
  # defined in this stack, or a full URL ("http://....) that can be reached from the container.
  #
  # Note that some of the parameters that are sent to the website are specific to tar1090
  # and they may not work for PiAware or SkyAware based implementation
  # Although it is theoretically possible to point at adsbexchange, we want to DISCOURAGE
  # people from doing this - our philosophy is to use LOCAL DATA as much as we can.

  # With thanks to tedder42 for the original program (https://github.com/tedder/browser-screenshot-service)

  # Last - note that this container is LARGE (~350 Mb download). If storage space is an issue
  # you may decide to forego this feature. Simply delete or comment out the section below.
