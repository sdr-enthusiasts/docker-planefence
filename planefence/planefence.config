# This defines which instance of dump1090[-fa] or readsb we get our data from
# By default, this is defined within the same docker container.
# If you haven't changed this, the value should be the "service name"
# as defined in docker-compose.yml
#
# If you run dump1090[-fa] or readsb in a different container or on a
# different machine, then you should put here the domain name of that machine.
# You should then configure your docker-compose.yml as described
# under (6) at https://github.com/kx1t/docker-planefence/blob/main/README.md

# The default size of the heatmap on the web page is configurable with
# the following variables. Note that "vh" and "vw" stand for "viewport height/width"
# The number is the percentage of the total window size that the map will take up.
#
# The default map zoom is also defined below. In the future, I am planning to dynamically
# determine this based on the radius of the fence, but for now, you can play with it
# manually. To experiment with the OpenSteetMap zoom function, browse to this URL,
# move to your own location, zoom in/out and observe the "map=xx" value change in the URL bar:

# PF_DELETEAFTER indicates how many days of logs and HTML / CSV files are kept around.
# If this variable is empty or does not exist, the default will be '14'.
# If you set PF_DELETEAFTER=0, data will be kept forever (and will fill up your SD card after a while!)

# PF_NOISECAPT provides the link to the URL where the NoiseCapt container is running
# See http://github.com/kx1t/docker-noisecapt for information
# - If you run the NoiseCapt container from the same docker-compose.yml file,
#   then set "PF_NOISECAPT=http://noisecapt"
# - If you don't want to run NoiseCapt, set to "PF_NOISECAPT="
# If you run it on a different machine, you should put the http link to the instance.

# PF_PLANEALERT enables a feature that monitors for a list of planes anywhere in the Feeder Station's
# coverage area.
# PF_PLANEALERT=ON means that you can find a ./plane-alert sub-page of your planefence web page.
#
# Plane-Alert can also send Twitter DMs when a plane on the alert list is detected.
# This assumes that you already configured PlaneFence for Twitter use, see "PF_TWEET" above and also README.md.
# For Plane-Alert tweeting to be on, PF_PA_TWID must contain one or more Twitter IDs. Multiple Twitter IDs should be comma separated.
# For example, FP_PA_TWID=12345678 or FP_PA_TWID=12345678,23456789,34567890
# IMPORTANT: these are NOT @names, but numeric account IDs. You can convert
# an @name to a Twitter ID at https://tweeterid.com/

# If PF_IGNOREDUPES is non-empty, the same ICAO+flight number combination
# during a single day will show only the first occurence thereof.
# Note - you can also filter by adding an explicit ignorelist, see the file
# ~/.planefence/planefence-ignore.txt for this
