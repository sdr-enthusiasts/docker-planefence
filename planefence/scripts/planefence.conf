# Feel free to make changes to the variables below. However, it is
# STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to RTFM! See explanation below and README.md for explanation of what these do.
#
#
# The web directory you want PlaneFence to write to:

	OUTFILEDIR=/usr/share/planefence/html

#
# the directory where this file and planefence.py are located:

	PLANEFENCEDIR=/usr/share/planefence

#
# MAXALT: only planes below this altitude are reported. Must correspond to the altitude unit set in socket30003.conf:

	MAXALT=5000

#
# DIST: only planes closer than this distance are reported:

	DIST=2.0

#
# Latitude and Longitude of the center point of the map (see also CALCDIST below)"

	LAT=12.34566 # Latitude of the center point of the map
	LON=-89.76543 # Longitude of the center point of the map

#
# HISTTIME: number of days shown in the history section of the website:

	HISTTIME=7

#
# CALCDIST determines if we will recalculate the distance to the plane based on the LON/LAT parameters provided above
# If set to CALCDIST="--calcdist", then:
#	- The system will recalculate the distance for every plane
#	- ATTENTION: the DIST parameter above will subsequently be interpreted in STATUTE (US) MILES
#	- If you prefer to use a different unit (km, nautical miles, etc.) please do NOT set CALCDIST="--calcdist"
# If set to CALCDIST="", then
#	- the system will interpret the distance provided by socket30003 in whatever the units are that socket30003 uses
#	- you MUST use this if your data is not in STATUTE MILES
#	- If you want to change the centerpoint of your calculations, you must change LONG/LAT in socket30003.conf. See that package
#	  for information on how to do this
#	- LON and LAT as defined above are only used in the title of the HTML page

#	CALCDIST="--calcdist"
	CALCDIST=""

#
# MY:text for the header of the website.

	MY="my"

#
# link for $MY in the website's header. This can be a full URL, or a relative location like ".."

	MYURL=".."

#
# Twitter handle for PlaneTweet. Comment this out if PlaneTweet is not available or disabled
# NOTE - if this field is defined and not empty, PlaneFence WILL try to invoke PlaneTweet to send a tweet!
# By default it's disabled. If enabled, note that tweeting will ONLY work if you also follow the PlaneTweet
# instructions for installation and set-up.

	PLANETWEET=

#
# ATTRIB contains the attribution line at the bottom of the tweet

        ATTRIB="(c) 2021 kx1t - docker:kx1t/planefence"

#
# PlaneHeat is an add-on that gets installed by default. It tracks a daily heatmap for planes that fly inside the
# PlaneFence coverage area. If you don't want to use it, comment out the parameter below.
# Normally, you don't need to update this parameter unless you moved 'planeheat.sh' to some other location,
# which we don't recommend doing unless you know which other files to move with it.

  PLANEHEATSCRIPT=$PLANEFENCEDIR/planeheat.sh

#
# HEATMAPHEIGHT determines the height of the heatmap on the website. The default is "40vh" which means 40% of the viewport height of the window
# Similarly, HEATMAPWIDTH determines the width of the heatmap on the website. The default is "75vw" which means 75% of the viewport width of the window.
# HEATMAPZOOM is the default OpenStreetMap zoom level for the map.

	HEATMAPHEIGHT=40vh
	HEATMAPWIDTH=75vw
	HEATMAPZOOM=13

# The next few variables are only relevant if you are using NoiseCapt
# Note - the system figures out by itself is NoiseCapt is running (by looking at the NoiseCapt Systemd Service), so you don't need to set this here.
# The next few variables define the background colors for the cell that contains the Loudness information on the website

	RED="LightCoral" # background cell color for Loudness
	YELLOW="Gold" # background cell color for Loudness
	GREEN="YellowGreen" # background cell color for Loudness

#
# These variables define the limit values for Loudness to be show green or yellow (instead of red)
# For example: if GREENLIMIT=9 and YELLOWLIMIT=16, then 9 dB or less loudness will show as $GREEN,
# 10-16 dB loudness will show as $YELLOW, and 17 dB or more loudness will show as $RED

	GREENLIMIT=9 # Max. Loudness level to be shown green
	YELLOWLIMIT=16 # Max. Loudness level to be shown yellow

#
# Last, a few variables related to logging:
#
# LOGFILE indicates where we write logs to.
# Use one of these:
# LOGFILE=/path/to/logfile.log
# LOGFILE=/dev/null # this switches off logging entirely
# LOGFILE=logger # if $LOGFILE is set to "logger", then the logs are written to /var/log/syslog. This is good for debugging purposes.
# LOGFILE=/dev/stdout # this writes the log to the terminal you're currently logged into. Normally not very useful.

	LOGFILE=/tmp/planefence.log

#
# VERBOSE indicates if we capture verbose information from planefence.py.
# The only valid values are VERBOSE="--verbose" and VERBOSE=""

	VERBOSE="--verbose"

#
# The following parameters define the file names of the temporary files and the output files
# If you set $OUTFILEDIR to the correct HTML path above, you shouldn't have to change anything here.

#
# TMPDIR is the location of the tmp directory, normally /tmp
  TMPDIR=/tmp

#
# LOGFILEBASE is the pull path name for the base part of the Socket30003 log file name.
# That file normally has the format /tmp/dump1090-127_0_0_1-[yymmdd].txt

  LOGFILEBASE=/run/socket30003/dump1090-127_0_0_1-

#
# OUTFILEBASE is the full path name for the base part of the output file

  OUTFILEBASE=$OUTFILEDIR/planefence

#
# OUTFILEHTML and OUTFILECSV are the full HTML / CSV file names that today's data will be written to.
# PLANEHEATHTML is the file name that the localized heatmap will be stored in.
#
# Note that planefence.sh will use FENCEDATE depending on the command line argument. If no command line
# argument is provided, 'today' is assumed.
# As such, you can rely on FENCEDATE to be the correct date string in the format "yymmdd".

  OUTFILEHTML=$OUTFILEBASE-$FENCEDATE.html
  OUTFILECSV=$OUTFILEBASE-$FENCEDATE.csv
  PLANEHEATHTML=$OUTFILEBASE-$FENCEDATE-heatmap.html
	OUTFILEHTMTMP=$OUTFILEHTML.tmp


# The script smartly only processes those lines from the socket30003 output file that haven't previously been assessed.
# When you run the script regularly (say, every 2 minutes), this will save you TONS of processing time. We need a few temp
# files to keep track of all of this:

  OUTFILETMP=$TMPDIR/dump1090-pf-temp.csv
  INFILETMP=$TMPDIR/dump1090-pf.txt
  TMPLINES=$TMPDIR/dump1090-pf-temp-$FENCEDATE.tmp

#
# HISTORY and HISTFILE:
# This is for future-proofing. Currently, the history data is written directly to the planefence HTML file.
# In the future, we are planning to create a separate history file that gets dynamically loaded as an IFRAME.
# The current approach has the advantage that each file, even old files, contains links to the 7 previous days
# counting from when the file was generated. The future change will only display the 7 days history from 'today',
# regardless of which (past) date you are looking at.

  HISTORY=history.html
  HISTFILE=$OUTFILEDIR/$HISTORY

#
# SOCKETCONFIG provides the location of the dump1090.socket30003.cfg file. This is used to get the default units of the log files

	SOCKETCONFIG=/usr/share/socket30003/socket30003.cfg

#
# PLANEHEATSCRIPT contains the location of the planeheat.sh. Comment it out if you don't want to generate heatmaps

	PLANEHEATSCRIPT=$PLANEFENCEDIR/planeheat.sh

#
# TRACKSERVICE determines of the flight URL links to FlightAware or ADSBExchange

       TRACKSERVICE=adsbexchange

# If NOISECAPT runs on a remote system, REMOTENOISE will contain the credentials to get the files.
# Two notes:
# - See noisecapt.sh for instructions on how to set this up
# - REMOTENOISE will be used to pass the username / remote-ip to SCP, as in "SCP user@remote:/file /local/file"
#   As such, make sure that REMOTENOISE contains the correct user@remote combo
# If you don't run NOISECAPT remotely, please comment out the parameter.

	REMOTENOISE=
	#REMOTENOISE=pi@10.0.0.161
	NOISEGRAPHBASE="noisegraph-$FENCEDATE"

#
# PLANEALERT is a separate script that can run to check if a plane with a specific ICAO was detected
# Set this parameter to true for the script to be invoked, comment it out for the script not to be invoked
# This feature was originally meant to see if a so-called "dictator plane" passed by the station
# and the ICAO list was derived from the planes that were heard by dictatoralert.org
# This list can be enhanced with any ICAO the user is interested in.
# DICTFILE contains the full path to dictalert.sh

	PLANEALERT=false
	PLALERTFILE=/usr/share/plane-alert/plane-alert.sh

#
# Last, the version. Although you could change this, for tracking purposes, we'd like you to leave it to whatever the
# official version number is. If you fork this software, we'd appreciate if you add on to the version number rather than
# replace the entire number. That way, it's easy to understand from which version you forked. For example, VERSION=3.11-myfork-1.0

  VERSION=4.0_docker
