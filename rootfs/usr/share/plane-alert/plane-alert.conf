# on. Please do NOT put spaces between the SQUAWK code. All SQUAWK codes shall be exactly 4 digits.
# Any squawk codes shorter or longer than that will be ignored.
# You can use (small letter) "x" for a single digit wildcard, for example 7x00 would represent 7000, 7100, ... etc up to 7900.
# If this variable is empty, Plane-Alert will not trigger on any SQUAWK codes.

# SCREENSHOTURL is the URL to the screenshotting container.
# Default value is http://screenshot:5042 which corresponds to the "screenshot" container (tedder42/browser-screenshot-service) as defined in the

# The URL should be called with GET /snap/xxxxxx (for example, http://screenshot:5042/snap/AC0220) and return a PNG image
# If you don't want to use this service, you can comment out the parameter, or simply not install the screenshot container.

# SQUAWKTIME is the minimum time (in seconds) between the first and the last occurrence of a specific Squawk code for a specific plane for the
