#
# The web directory you want Planefence to write to:

	OUTFILEDIR=/usr/share/planefence/html

#
# the directory where this file and planefence.py are located:

	PLANEFENCEDIR=/usr/share/planefence

#
# MAXALT: only planes below this altitude are reported. Must correspond to the altitude unit set in socket30003.conf:

	MAXALT=5000

#
# ALTCORR: Local altitude above sea level

  ALTCORR=0

#
# DIST: only planes closer than this distance are reported:

	DIST=2.0

#
# Latitude and Longitude of the center point of the map (see also CALCDIST below)"

	LAT=12.34566 # Latitude of the center point of the map
	LON=-89.76543 # Longitude of the center point of the map

#
# HISTTIME: number of days shown in the history section of the website:

	HISTTIME=14

#
# COLLAPSEWITHIN: number of seconds between end time of an entry to start time of new entry within which
# 				  the two entries will be collapsed

	COLLAPSEWITHIN=300

#
# MY:text for the header of the website.

	MY="my"

#
# link for $MY in the website's header. This can be a full URL, or a relative location like ".."

	MYURL=".."

#
# Twitter handle for PlaneTweet. Comment this out if PlaneTweet is not available or disabled
# NOTE - if this field is defined and not empty, Planefence WILL try to invoke PlaneTweet to send a tweet!
# By default it's disabled. If enabled, note that tweeting will ONLY work if you also follow the PlaneTweet
# instructions for installation and set-up.

	PLANETWEET=

# NOTIF_DATEFORMAT is the date/time format for all notifications except MQTT and Discord which use their own format
	NOTIF_DATEFORMAT="%F %T %Z"

#
# ATTRIB contains the attribution line at the bottom of the tweet

	ATTRIB="#adsb #planefence by kx1t•https://sdr-e.com/docker-planefence"

#
# PlaneHeat is an add-on that gets installed by default. It tracks a daily heatmap for planes that fly inside the
# Planefence coverage area. If you don't want to use it, set PLANEHEAT=OFF.
# Normally, you don't need to update this parameter unless you moved 'planeheat.sh' to some other location,
# which we don't recommend doing unless you know which other files to move with it.

  PLANEHEAT=ON
  PLANEHEATSCRIPT=$PLANEFENCEDIR/planeheat.sh

#
# HEATMAPHEIGHT determines the height of the heatmap on the website. The default is "40vh" which means 40% of the viewport height of the window
# Similarly, HEATMAPWIDTH determines the width of the heatmap on the website. The default is "75vw" which means 75% of the viewport width of the window.
# HEATMAPZOOM is the default OpenStreetMap zoom level for the map.

	HEATMAPHEIGHT=40vh
	HEATMAPWIDTH=75vw
	HEATMAPZOOM=13

# The next few variables are only relevant if you are using NoiseCapt
# Note - the system figures out by itself is NoiseCapt is running (by looking at the NoiseCapt Systemd Service), so you don't need to set this here.
# The next few variables define the background colors for the cell that contains the Loudness information on the website

	RED="LightCoral" # background cell color for Loudness
	YELLOW="Gold" # background cell color for Loudness
	GREEN="YellowGreen" # background cell color for Loudness

#
# These variables define the limit values for Loudness to be show green or yellow (instead of red)
# For example: if GREENLIMIT=9 and YELLOWLIMIT=16, then 9 dB or less loudness will show as $GREEN,
# 10-16 dB loudness will show as $YELLOW, and 17 dB or more loudness will show as $RED

	GREENLIMIT=9 # Max. Loudness level to be shown green
	YELLOWLIMIT=16 # Max. Loudness level to be shown yellow

#
# Last, a few variables related to logging:
#
# LOGFILE indicates where we write logs to.
# Use one of these:
# LOGFILE=/path/to/logfile.log
# LOGFILE=/dev/null # this switches off logging entirely
# LOGFILE=logger # if $LOGFILE is set to "logger", then the logs are written to /var/log/syslog. This is good for debugging purposes.
# LOGFILE=/dev/stdout # this writes the log to the terminal you're currently logged into. Normally not very useful.

	LOGFILE=/dev/stdout

#
# VERBOSE indicates if we capture verbose information from planefence.py.
# The only valid values are VERBOSE="--verbose" and VERBOSE=""

	VERBOSE="--verbose"

#
# The following parameters define the file names of the temporary files and the output files
# If you set $OUTFILEDIR to the correct HTML path above, you shouldn't have to change anything here.

#
# TMPDIR is the location of the tmp directory, normally /tmp
  TMPDIR=/tmp

#
# LOGFILEBASE is the full path name for the base part of the Socket30003 log file name.
# That file normally has the format /tmp/dump1090-127_0_0_1-[yymmdd].txt

  LOGFILEBASE=/run/socket30003/dump1090-127_0_0_1-

#
# OUTFILEBASE is the full path name for the base part of the output file

  OUTFILEBASE=$OUTFILEDIR/planefence

#
# OUTFILEHTML and OUTFILECSV are the full HTML / CSV file names that today's data will be written to.
# PLANEHEATHTML is the file name that the localized heatmap will be stored in.
#
# Note that planefence.sh will use FENCEDATE depending on the command line argument. If no command line
# argument is provided, 'today' is assumed.
# As such, you can rely on FENCEDATE to be the correct date string in the format "yymmdd".

  OUTFILEHTML=$OUTFILEBASE-$FENCEDATE.html
  OUTFILECSV=$OUTFILEBASE-$FENCEDATE.csv
  PLANEHEATHTML=$OUTFILEBASE-$FENCEDATE-heatmap.html

  AUTOREFRESH=true


# The script smartly only processes those lines from the socket30003 output file that haven't previously been assessed.
# When you run the script regularly (say, every 2 minutes), this will save you TONS of processing time. We need a few temp
# files to keep track of all of this:

  OUTFILETMP=$TMPDIR/dump1090-pf-temp.csv
  INFILETMP=$TMPDIR/dump1090-pf.txt
  TMPLINES=/usr/share/planefence/persist/.internal/dump1090-pf-temp-$FENCEDATE.tmp
  TOTLINES=/usr/share/planefence/persist/.internal/dump1090-pf-total-$FENCEDATE.tmp

#
# HISTORY and HISFILE:
# This is for future-proofing. Currently, the history data is written directly to the planefence HTML file.
# In the future, we are planning to create a separate history file that gets dynamically loaded as an IFRAME.
# The current approach has the advantage that each file, even old files, contains links to the 7 previous days
# counting from when the file was generated. The future change will only display the 7 days history from 'today',
# regardless of which (past) date you are looking at.

  HISTORY=history.html
  HISFILE=$OUTFILEDIR/$HISTORY

#
# SOCKETCONFIG provides the location of the dump1090.socket30003.cfg file. This is used to get the default units of the log files

  SOCKETCONFIG=/usr/share/socket30003/socket30003.cfg

#
# TRACKSERVICE determines of the flight URL links to FlightAware or ADSBExchange
# Valid values are "adsbexchange" and "flightaware"

  TRACKSERVICE=adsbexchange

# If NOISECAPT runs on a remote system, REMOTENOISE will contain the credentials to get the files.
# Two notes:
# - See noisecapt.sh for instructions on how to set this up
# - REMOTENOISE will be used to pass the username / remote-ip to SCP, as in "SCP user@remote:/file /local/file"
#   As such, make sure that REMOTENOISE contains the correct user@remote combo
# If you don't run NOISECAPT remotely, please comment out the parameter.

	REMOTENOISE=
	NOISEGRAPHBASE="noisegraph-$FENCEDATE"

#
# PLANEALERT is a separate script that can run to check if a plane with a specific ICAO was detected
# Set this parameter to true for the script to be invoked, comment it out for the script not to be invoked
# This feature was originally meant to see if a so-called "dictator plane" passed by the station
# and the ICAO list was derived from the planes that were heard by dictatoralert.org
# This list can be enhanced with any ICAO the user is interested in.
# PLALERTFILE contains the full path to plane-alert.sh

	PLANEALERT=OFF
	PLALERTFILE=/usr/share/plane-alert/plane-alert.sh

#
# AIRLINECODES contains the directory where the file with the airline code translation table can be located. If there is none, leave it empty
# OWNERDBCACHE is the cache time (in days) for the any N-number lookup results in the FAA database. We cache these values not to overburden
# the FAA database with recursive lookups, however, we want the cache to expire once in a while so new owner names are picked up
# Suggestion is to set this to around 7 (days).
# REMOTEMISSCACHE is the time between 2 missed queries to the database. To avoid spamming this, we check every 7200 (seconds) = 2 hours

#
# IGNORELIST points at a file that contains grep expressions that are used to filter the incoming planes
# These are "grepped" out from OUTFILECSV, so the IGNORELIST file can have anything from ICAO, Flight numbers, 3-letter airline codes, dates, etc.
# as long as these items are represented in OUTFILECSV. This means that 'AAL' would work as a filter, but 'American Airlines' would not.

# rounded as to hide your exact location
# Edits 8-feb-2022: now also support values 0 and 1.
# FUDGELOC=2 will round your LAT/LON to the nearest 0.01 degrees (2 decimals). The actual
#               distance will vary depending on your latitude, but around 42 deg N, this is
#               about 0.5 miles / 0.75 km
# FUDGELOC=3 will round your LAT/LON to the nearest 0.001 degrees (3 decimals). This
#               corresponds to about 300 ft / 100 m at 42 deg N.
# FUDGELOC set to any other non-empty value is the same as PF_FUDGELOC=3

	FUDGELOC=

#
# SCREENSHOTURL is the URL to the screenshotting container.
# Default value is http://screenshot:5042 which corresponds to the "screenshot" container (tedder42/browser-screenshot-service) as defined in the
# example docker-compose.yml file.
# The URL should be called with GET /snap/xxxxxx (for example, http://screenshot:5042/snap/AC0220) and return a PNG image
